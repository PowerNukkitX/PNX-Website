### Steps to install PNX server based on PNX-CLI-Windows-x86
#### Installation steps
1. Download the PNX-CLI-Windows-x86.zip archive [Download](https://github.com/PowerNukkitX/PNX-CLI/releases)
2. Extract the PNX-CLI-Windows-x86.zip archive using ZIP
3. Win+R to open the Run window, type cmd in the Run window to open the command window that comes with Windows
4. Find the folder where your PNX.exe is located on the disk
----
**Example** :\
My PNX.exe is in the **F disk** \ desktop\pnx-CLI folder
```
F:\Desktop\pnx-CLI
```
We need to point the command window to the corresponding folder
```
C:\Users\ASUS>F: CD F:\Desktop\pnx-CLI
```
**F:\Desktop\pnx-CLI**\
This section is under the folder where your PNX.exe is located

----
5. Enter the following command in the command box to install the PNX Quick Deployment Tool, once installed, you will be able to use the PNX-CLI related commands wherever you are in the command box\
**Note: You will need to restart CMD or PowerShell after the installation is complete**
```
pnx sys-install
```
6. Enter the following command in the command box to check if your computer is installing the JAVA 17 environment
```
pnx jvm check
``` 
7. Enter the following command in the command box to check for an installable JVM

pnx jvm remote
```
Choose any of the following JVMs to install on your computer
1. GraalVM (349MB)
2. AdoptOpenJDK (41.1MB)
- It is highly recommended to use GraalVM JAVA. this will make your PowerNukkitX faster in Java and JavaScript
8. Enter the following command in the command box to install the JVM (skip installation)
```
pnx jvm install=GraalVM  
```
or
```
pnx jvm install=AdoptOpenJDK
```
9. Enter the following command in the command box to install the PNX server core
```
pnx server install
```
This will bring up the PNX master branch cores updated within the last 30 days\
Enter the number of the corresponding branch after the text below to download it

```
10. Enter the following command in the command box to install the dependent libraries required for PNX to run
```
pnx libs -u
```
11. Double-click PNX.exe to start the server\

### Overview

Have you been running BDS for years and now want to switch to PowerNukkitX?
> Example: [How could I convert BedrockSever1.18 world to Nukkit?](https://cloudburstmc.org/threads/how-could-i-convert-bedrocksever1-18-world-to-nukkit.1449/)

Have you already enjoyed the plugin ecosystem of JE or want to convert a purchased JE map to PowerNukkitX?

Although you have already seen the epic terrain provided by Terra, do you want to use your own map?

After reading the tutorial below, you will not need to ask for help from anyone or any tool like WorldFixed!

### Choose Our Tools

- [AmuletMC](https://www.amuletmc.com/)
- [PNXWorldConverter](https://github.com/PowerNukkitX/PNXWorldConverter/blob/patch/chs/README_CHS.md) - [Go to download](https://github.com/PowerNukkitX/PNXWorldConverter/releases/latest)

### The Idea of Conversion

Allow me to briefly introduce these two tools.

AmuletMC is a tool developed by **Amulet-Team** that can convert JE/BE maps of any version. We can use it to convert maps that PNXWorldConverter cannot perfectly handle to `JE 1.15-1.19` map versions that PNXWorldConverter can handle perfectly.

Then we use PNXWorldConverter to convert the map to a format that PNX can load.

### Practice
